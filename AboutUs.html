<p><font size="4">
Gethsemane Lutheran Church is a member congregation of the Lutheran
Church Missouri Synod.
We are here to proclaim the gospel, the good news that God has saved us
not because of deeds which we have done in righteousness but because of
the life, death, and resurrection of
Jesus Christ. Because of Christ, sin is forgiven and life and
immortality is brought to light. &nbsp;</font></p>

<center><hl><big><big>What We Offer</big></big></hl></center>
<p><font size="4">* Divine Service- This is the central activity at
Gethsemane and the most important event of the week. In our Divine
Service, Christ Himself is present to grant us forgiveness, life, and
salvation, and to strengthen us by His Word and Gifts. Please see our commuion statement below. Our Divine
Services are Thursday evening at 7:00 PM and Sunday mornings at
10:30 AM</font></p>

<center><h1><small><small><font size="6"><small><small>What We Value as a Congregation</small></small></font></small></small></h1></center>
<h2><small>Holy Scripture</small></h2>
<p> We believe that Prophetic and Apostolic Scriptures of the Old and
New Testaments are not just the word of men but the very Word of God
spoken through men chosen by the Holy Spirt. Therefore the
Scriptures speak with authority to all Christians and are the pure guide for judging all
doctrines and teachers.</p><h2><small>The Creeds</small></h2>
<p>We confess the faith with all true believers
in the Apostle's, Nicene, and
Athanasian Creeds. We joyfully share that faith with Christians of all
times and places.</p><h2><small>The Lutheran Confessions</small> </h2>
<p>We adhere to the Lutheran Confessions of the 16th century found in the Book of Concord. We believe that the confessions speak
with authority on matters of faith because they have been formed and
shaped by Holy Scripture.</p><h2><small>The Sacraments</small></h2>
<p>We believe that God comes to us in specific ways. He comes to us
through the Word rightly preached and the Sacraments offered according
to their institution by Christ. We emphasize the importance of Baptism
and it's implications for daily life. We celebrate the Lord's Supper
every Lord's day and on special feast days. We offer absolution in a
general way at the beginning of Divine service and, as often as the
Christian feels the need, in a private setting. We believe that God
works through these to deliver forgiveness, life, and salvation to His
people.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><small>The Liturgy</small></h2>
<p>The liturgy is the order of service developed from Biblical times
through the Christian era. In it we find something from the Church of
all ages. These orders of service have fed Christians through the
centuries. In the liturgy we hear God's Word and speak it back to Him
and to one another. We hold to this very traditional form of worship as
a teacher of the faith.</p><h2><small>Our Evangelical Heritage</small></h2>
<p>We believe that man is hopelessly lost in sin and cannot save
himself. Mankind has hope because God has sent us a Savior, Jesus
Christ. It is only in Christ that we have salvation. Our Lord tells us
that He is the way, the truth, and the life, and that no one comes to
the Father except through Him. &nbsp;He who has the Son, has life.
&nbsp;He who does not have the Son does not have life, but the wrath of
God abides on Him. &nbsp;Scripture emphasizes that we have been
justified, declared righteous, by faith in Christ alone. Jesus promises
that no one who comes to Him will be turned away.&nbsp;
Our preaching and teaching is centered in this good news and it affects
all
that we do as aChurch.</p><p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><big>A Statmenet on Communing at Gethsemane</big></p>

<p class="Body">Our congregation practices the historic custom of closed
communion. When you commune at any Church, you are making a public confession
that you are in agreement with what that Church teaches.<span style="">Communion
fellowship implies agreement on the chief parts of the Christian Faith.
&nbsp;Sadly, that agreement is lacking among various Christian Church
bodies.&nbsp; </span>Gethsemane belongs to the Lutheran Church
Missouri Synod, because we agree with the doctrine taught among its churches
and those churches in altar and pulpit fellowship with the LCMS. We believe in
the real presence of Christ's body and blood in the Sacrament.
Everyone who receives Communion here receives Christ's body and blood into
their mouth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those who receive it in
faith take it to their salvation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those
who eat and drink in unbelief and unrepentance take the supper to their
condemnation.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If you are a member in
good standing of an LCMS congregation, come with a repentant heart believing in
the promises Christ makes to us in Holy Communion, you are invited to partake.
If you do not belong to an LCMS congregation, we respectfully ask you to
abstain until such time as agreement in Christian doctrine is reached.<span style=""> &nbsp;See our doctrinal teachings on the 'What We Believe' section of our web site. </span>The pastor will be happy to
answer your questions regarding this practice after the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>
