<p>Daily Psalm- Psalm 28:1- 9</p>
<p>Psalm 28:1 - 29:1  A Psalm of David. To You I will cry, O LORD my Rock: Do not be silent to me, Lest, if You are silent to me, I become like those who go down to the pit.  2 Hear the voice of my supplications When I cry to You, When I lift up my hands toward Your holy sanctuary.  3 Do not take me away with the wicked And with the workers of iniquity, Who speak peace to their neighbors, But evil is in their hearts.  4 Give them according to their deeds, And according to the wickedness of their endeavors; Give them according to the work of their hands; Render to them what they deserve.  5 Because they do not regard the works of the LORD, Nor the operation of His hands, He shall destroy them And not build them up.  6 Blessed be the LORD, Because He has heard the voice of my supplications!  7 The LORD is my strength and my shield; My heart trusted in Him, and I am helped; Therefore my heart greatly rejoices, And with my song I will praise Him.  8 The LORD is their strength, And He is the saving refuge of His anointed.  9 Save Your people, And bless Your inheritance; Shepherd them also, And bear them up forever.</p>
<p> Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.  As it was in the beginning, is now, and will be forever. Amen.</p>
<p>Daily Reading 1 Timothy 4:1- 18</p>
<p>2 Timothy 4:1-18   I charge you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom:  2 Preach the word! Be ready in season and out of season. Convince, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching.  3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers;  4 and they will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables.  5 But you be watchful in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.  6 For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure is at hand.  7 I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.  8 Finally, there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give to me on that Day, and not to me only but also to all who have loved His appearing.  9 Be diligent to come to me quickly;  10 for Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world, and has departed for Thessalonica -- Crescens for Galatia, Titus for Dalmatia.  11 Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for ministry.  12 And Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.  13 Bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas when you come -- and the books, especially the parchments.  14 Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm. May the Lord repay him according to his works.  15 You also must beware of him, for he has greatly resisted our words.  16 At my first defense no one stood with me, but all forsook me. May it not be charged against them.  17 But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, so that the message might be preached fully through me, and that all the Gentiles might hear. And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.  18 And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work and preserve me for His heavenly kingdom. To Him be glory forever and ever. Amen!</p>
<p>Proclamation</p>
<p>Paul exhorts Timothy to preach the Word, "in season and out of season." Pastors are called to faithfully preach Christ when the message of Christ is received peacefully and when it is opposed.  Sometimes the faithful preaching of the Word is met with opposition, sometimes with indifference, and sometimes it is even abandoned by those who prevoiusly received it with joy.  Paul endured all this as he faithfully proclaimed the Word of Christ, and he warns Timothy that all who preach the Word will endure the same.</p>
<p> Just as God calls pastors to faithful preaching, so He calls hearers to faithful hearing.  The people of God should expect that their pastor will preach the Word whether he feels like it or not.  They should expect that He will be faithful to pure Word and never be influenced by what the world with its itching ears will tolerate.  They have the right to expect that the pastor will preach sound doctrine above all and should not tolerate any sort of deviant preaching which amounts to blasphemy.</p>
<p> But if God exhorts pastors to pure preaching, He also requires that His people hear such preaching with gladness.  The third commandment requires us to, "not despise preaching and His Word, but hold it sacred and gladly hear and learn it." The Christian should support the preaching of the Word to the best of his ability. Far too often God's people neglect to hear the Word and treat the pure preaching of the Word with disdain.  This is true even when the pastor is a poor preacher, too long winded, or has obvious personal faults.  To neglect the Word is a grievous sin before God and Christians who turn from hearing the Word are without excuse.</p>
<p>God earnestly exhorts us to the hearing of the Word because through the Word, even through the stuttering lips of a poor preacher, God feeds and strengthens His people.  In the preaching of Christ, the Christian is fed as with daily bread.  In preaching, we not only hear about the gifts that God has given us through Christ, but the Holy Spirit again and again applies those gifts to us, comforts us, consoles us, and strengthens us witht the forgiveness of sins earned for us by the death and ressurection of our Lord.  In preaching, the crown of righteousness is bestowed on all who hear and believe.  By hearing God's Word, we are strengthened to fight the good fight of faith, so that when we finish our race we will receive the ultimate gift of eternal life bestowed on all who wait for the blessed appearing of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.  May God continue to grant the Church militant faithful preaching and faithful hearing.
