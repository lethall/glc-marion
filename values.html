<center><h1>Values Statement</h1></center>

<ol>

<p><li><b>Scripture - </b> We believe that God’s word is a <i><b><font color="#338833">lamp
to our feet and a light to our path.</i></b></font>

<p>
Therefore we want God’s word to permeate all that we do as a
church.  We value the proclamation of God’s word in public
worship, Christian education, and in the devotinal life of
believers.  We long as a church to remain true to God’s word. 

<p><li><b>Christ Centered Preaching - </b>

We believe that God saves men through the <i><b><font color="#338833">preaching of the
cross.</i></b></font>  Also that God provides comfort and faith to believers
through the same.

<p>
Therefore we desire that the preaching within the public service
not be a how-to-manual for successful living, but a proclamation
of God’s saving mercy in Christ from the pages of scripture.

<p><li><b>The Sacraments -</b>
We believe that God comes to us with all his gifts through word
and sacrament alone.

<p>
Therefore we value the regular celebration of the Lord’s Supper. 
We desire that every Christian know the blessings bestowed in
Baptism and Communion and value them highly.

<p><li><b>Evangelism -</b>
Christ calls his church to <i><b><font color="#338833">go and make disciples of all
nations.</i></b></font>

<p>
Therefore both as a church and individually we desire to be about
the business of making disciples through the gospel.  We will
hold this responsiblity up before our members, provide training
for each Christian to walk in this mission, and provide
opportunities for the church to corporately share in that
mission.

<p><li><b>Confessional Integrity -</b>
We believe that the Lutheran confessions of the sixteenth century
are an accurate presentation of the clear teachings of scripture.

<p>
Therefore we value the heritage given us in the Lutheran
confessions and the unity with our fellow churches in Christ. In
all our teaching, preaching, and practice we will remain faithful
to the confessions. 

<p><li><b>The Catechism -</b>
We value the use of Luther’s Small Catechism in the instruction
of the young, and use it as a model for the instruction of
adults.  We believe it is an excellent teacher of the faith, and
use it in all facets of Christian instruction.

<p><li><b>Liturgical Worship -</b>
Knowing that the liturgy has been used by the church in all ages,
and understanding that it is a teacher of the faith, we value
liturgical worship over other forms of worship.
