Near Reformation Day, Gethsemane participates in a Conference on the
Augsburg Confession arranged by the Augustana Society, a group of
laypeople and pastors in central Ohio interested in promoting the
Lutheran Confessions. &nbsp;Details for the 2017 Conference are being
arranged and will be announced after Easter. <br>
