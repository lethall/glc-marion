# Proposed Amendments to Assembly Notification

At present, it is required by Gethsemane Congregational Constitution that a two-week notice be given in advance of a Voter Assembly.

## Introduction

The Gethsemane constitution was modeled after those of similarly-sized congregations in 2003. At that time, in-person notifications of Voter Assembly were the most reliable means. Many improvements in communication technology have enabled several means of nearly-immediate notifications.

There have been several situations over the past few years where the two-week in-person notice has posed some problems. The proposed amendments are broken into two parts in order to enable more timely decisions. It should not be assumed that considerations be made more hastily, but rather that a Voter Assembly can be had more often without the need for in-person notifications.

As it is, if a matter is tabled for later consideration in a Voter Assembly meeting it will potentially need to wait for three weeks to be considered again (the two-week notice given on the Sunday after the current meeting). This is untenable when time-sensitive decisions need to be made, often requiring that the decision be delegated to representatives such as the Steering Committee or the Elders. More frequent meetings should also result in shorter meetings, since there would be less need for immediate decisions to be made.

## Electronic Notification Amendment

Given the abundance of reliable electronic communication avenues available as of 2026, announcements of upcoming Voter Assembly may be made in at least two forms: SMS text message and the congregational social media page (presently Facebook but that might change). Additional forms, such as the congregational website can also be provided.

The notification should include a preliminary agenda. Subsequent refinements to the agenda will not restart the notification period.

## One Week Advance Notice Amendment

Given the need for the congregation to make serious decisions, more - and shorter - Voter Assembly meetings could be had.

If the need for a subsequent meeting is realized in a given meeting AND the Electronic Notification Amendment is adopted, it would be possible to continue a matter to the next week if notification is provided immediately at the conclusion of the current meeting.
