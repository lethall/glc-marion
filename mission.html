to the web home of Gethsemane Lutheran Church. We are a Lutheran (LCMS)
congregation in downtown Marion, Ohio. Each week we gather to hear the
good news of God's mercy in Jesus Christ, our Savior. Together
we&nbsp;are renewed in our baptism, receive absolution, and receive
Holy Communion through which God gives us forgiveness, life, and
salvation.&nbsp;We believe the Holy Scriptures found in the Old and
New Testaments are the inerrant Word of God and confess the teachings
of
the evangelical Lutheran church found in the Book of Concord as the
true doctrine of Christ drawn from the Scriptures. &nbsp;We welcome you
to come and hear the good news with us.<br>

two cycles of the Church year meet at Pentecost Sunday and Holy Trinity
Sunday. &nbsp;The Festival season&nbsp;begins with Advent and takes us
through the life of Christ. It reminds of the saving acts of God's Son
on our Behalf. &nbsp;It reminds us of His incarnation, manifestion to
the nations, His suffering and death, His glorious resurrection, and
finally His ascension at the right hand of God. &nbsp;The Festival
season ends with the celebration of Pentecost in which the risen and
ascended Lord pours out the Holy Spirit upon the Church. &nbsp;<br><br>The
Trinity Season takes up where Pentecost leaves off. &nbsp;Christ has
poured out His Spirit upon the Church and, as our Lord promised the
disciples, the Holy Spirit brings to mind all that Christ said to them.
&nbsp;So, while the first half of the Church year focuses on the doing
of Christ, the second half, the Trinity season focuses on the teachings
of Christ. &nbsp;Through the teaching of Christ, which the Holy Spirit
empowers the apostles to remember, the Holy Spirit now leads the Church
into all truth, the truth that Jesus taught us. &nbsp;<br></div><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;
