      Gethsemane Lutheran Church is a member church of the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod.
      We exist for and because of the gospel, the good news that God has saved us without any merit or worthiness on
      our part but purely out of mercy because of the work of Jesus Christ on our behalf. We endeavor to make that
      gospel known in our community and beyond. We rejoice in the life that Christ has given us by His life, death, and
      resurrection and we gratefully receive His gifts of forgiveness, life and salvation as we gather with Christ
      Himself to receive those gifts.</font>

    <font size="4">* Divine Service- This is the central activity at Gethsemane and the most important event of the
      week. In our Divine Service, Christ Himself is present to grant us forgiveness, life, and salvation, and to
      strengthen us by His Word and Gifts. Our Divine Service is Sunday mornings at 10:30 AM
  </p>
  <p> * Adult Bible Class and Sunday School- God has provided His Word so that we might study, mark, and inwardly
    digest it. On Sunday mornings before the Divine Service we meet to study His Word so that we might know our Savior
    better. If you would like to know the Scriptures better, this is an excellent opportunity for you to do so. Sunday
    school and Bible class begins at 9:15 AM.</p>
  <p> * Thursday Night Bible Study- This is another opportunity learn God's Word. This is often a study of a particular
    book. We meet downstairs off the parlor at 7:00 PM
    <p> * Christian Faith Class- This is an introduction to the Christian Faith as it is taught in the Lutheran Church.
      This is a ten week class that prepares you for membership at Gethsemane. This class is now meeting Saturdays at
      noon downstairs off the parlor.</p>
    <p> * Pastoral Visit- If you are unsure about Church but would like to find out more about us, you can call for a
      visit with the pastor. If you or a loved one is in need of pastoral care but you do not have a pastor, feel free
      to call Pastor Brett.</font>
